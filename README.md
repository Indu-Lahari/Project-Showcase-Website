# Project Showcase Website

## Project Description

The Project Showcase Website is an online portfolio designed to highlight my Python programming skills and showcase various projects. The website is built using Streamlit and includes two main components: a homepage that displays a portfolio of projects and a contact form to facilitate communication.

## Process

1. **Homepage (`home.py`):**
   - Designed to provide an overview of my background and showcase a selection of Python projects.
   - Utilizes columns to layout content and images.
   - Displays project details and provides links to the source code.

2. **Contact Form (`contact_me.py`):**
   - A form that allows users to send me messages directly from the website.
   - Integrated with Gmail for sending emails.
   - Includes fields for user email and message content.

3. **Email Sending (`gmail.py`):**
   - Handles the functionality to send emails using Gmail's SMTP server.
   - Configured with SSL for secure communication.

## Technology Used

- **Streamlit:** Framework used for creating the interactive web application.
- **Pandas:** Library used for reading and displaying project data from a CSV file.
- **SMTP:** Protocol used for sending emails.
- **Gmail:** Email service used for receiving and sending messages.

## What I Learned

- **Streamlit Development:**
  - Gained experience in building interactive web applications with Streamlit.
  - Learned how to layout content using columns and display images and text dynamically.

- **Data Handling:**
  - Utilized Pandas to read and process project data from a CSV file.
  - Implemented data visualization within the web application.

- **Email Integration:**
  - Integrated email functionality into the website, learning about SMTP and secure email communication.

- **Web Development Practices:**
  - Applied best practices for building user-friendly web interfaces and handling user inputs.

## Future Insights

  - Implementing a more sophisticated contact form with additional fields and validations.
  - Adding a search functionality to filter and find projects more easily.

- **Design Improvements:**
  - Upgrading the websiteâ€™s design with more advanced styling and responsive features.

- **Backend Integration:**
  - Exploring options for integrating a backend database to manage project data dynamically.

- **User Experience:**
  - Enhancing the user experience with interactive elements and improved navigation.

Feel free to explore the code for each component:
- `home.py` for the homepage
- `contact_me.py` for the contact form
- `gmail.py` for the email sending functionality

Happy exploring!
